    <p>
      TheCollections is an exhibition curation platform developed by <a href="https://www.tomglencross.com/about" target="_blank" class="underline">Tom Glencross</a>. It queries collections from two APIs: the <a href="https://finds.org.uk/portable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline">Portable Antiquities Scheme</a> and <a href="https://www.europeana.eu/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="underline">Europeana</a>. 
    </p>
    <p class="pt-5 pb-1">TheCollections allows users to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>- Browse artefacts, records and artworks in paginated lists with intuitive navigation and within a clean and accessible framework.</li>
      <li>- Filter and sort artworks to easily find works of interest.</li>
      <li>- View detailed information and images of each exhibit.</li>
      <li>- Create their own temporary exhibitions by saving and managing selected artworks.</li>
      <li>- Access and edit their curated exhibitions anytime â€” stored locally and in app state.</li>
    </ul>
<p class="pt-5">
